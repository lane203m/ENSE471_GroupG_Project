## Introduction

This tool is entirely made with HTML, JavaScript and CSS. It also uses Bootstrap's CSS.

### Note

1. This has been successfully tested for chrome and Samsung internet browser on smart phones.

2. This tool also works on Chrome, Edge, and Firefox via desktop/personal computer.

3. This tool does not work for mobile devices using safari or firefox

4. Other mobile browsers may or may not be compatible.

## Usage

While you can install this to any device(s), the easiest way for a large deployment is to host the webpage on a domain or server - which grants greater accesibility. Really, we want anything easily accessible by your staff from the web.

### Installation

If you simply wish to install this to a device, like a personal computer/phone - do the following:

1. download a copy of our repository, specifically the src folder. It can be downloaded anywhere you like.

2. Extract the contents if they are compressed.

You have now downloaded the tool. To run it, open the source folder and double click `run.html`
You may also navigate to `src/home/index.html` for the same effect.

If you would prefer to host this on a domain, you will need to add the src folder to your server and redirect to index.html by some means.

Or, set home as your root folder/landing page.
